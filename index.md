## Problem Statement 
Of the 1.4 million students who study at Canadian Universities, 10% move provinces to, and  another 10% originate from outside of Canada. These students often relocate with a limited or non-existent social, professional, or other type of network in their new city 
This can lead to feelings of isolation contributing to higher levels of mental illness, poor university experience, academic performance, attrition,
Expressions of gratitude can help nurture community and help form deep and meaningful connections - absolving such feelings of isolation and subsequent effects.
In this project we design a solution which helps lower social barriers, allowing for more gratitude sharing between students to foster community and minimize feelings of isolation.

## Formative evaluation 
Provide a brief summary of your formative evaluation process and findings. Brainsketching activity may come of use here. 



## Persona
Succinctly present your main persona, your scenario, and the storyboard you created. Be selective in choosing what to highlight from this. You likely produced more artefacts than you will want to highlight. But these sections should be driven by artefacts and not by descriptions of them.

## Goals

|![Checkbox](./images/check.jpg) | Build a support system to help her achieve success |
|![Checkbox](./images/check.jpg) | Build stronger connections to combat loneliness from moving | 
|![Checkbox](./images/check.jpg) | Express more gratitude as a way of building more meaningful connections |

## Tasks / Scenario
Rachel has a huge test coming up and is feeling stressed. She's been studying for a long time but is stuck on one problem and is starting to feel overwhelmed. To help with the problem, she asks a classmate for help the classmate was able to explain the problem in a way that made sense to Rachel. She is very thankful for the classmate's help and wants a way to express her gratitude in a more meaningful way but she doesn't know how to do so. She also thinks this is a perfect opportunity to deepen her connection with the classmate.

## Prototype Overview 
Provide a brief overview of your prototype, including a description of its design, rationales for the design choices, and images as necessary to communicates its overall design. You should as a general rule embed your video prototype here (though as this has already been evaluated separately you will not be graded down for not including it if there is some technical or practical challenge in doing so).

## Feedback 
Briefly describe how the prototype was evaluated and highlight key findings, especially any that were surprising or went against your expectations. Being able to interpret the findings and select which are most useful to share is as important as being able to collect the data in the first place.


## Redesign 
Present the next progression of your design idea. Note that we are cutting our iterative process off at this stage and keeping it brief. You should use this design phase to articulate how your evaluation findings are moving forward your design thinking. You do not need to build out an entire interface.
