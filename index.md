# Group 2 Gratitude Kits

## Problem Statement 
Of the 1.4 million students who study at Canadian Universities, 10% move provinces to, and  another 10% originate from outside of Canada. These students often relocate with a limited or non-existent social, professional, or other type of network in their new city 
This can lead to feelings of isolation contributing to higher levels of mental illness, poor university experience, academic performance, attrition,
Expressions of gratitude can help nurture community and help form deep and meaningful connections - absolving such feels of isolation and subsequent effects

## Formative evaluation 
Provide a brief summary of your formative evaluation process and findings. Brainsketching activity may come of use here. 



## Persona, scenario, and storyboard
Succinctly present your main persona, your scenario, and the storyboard you created. Be selective in choosing what to highlight from this. You likely produced more artefacts than you will want to highlight. But these sections should be driven by artefacts and not by descriptions of them.

## Storyboard 


## Prototype Overview 
Provide a brief overview of your prototype, including a description of its design, rationales for the design choices, and images as necessary to communicates its overall design. You should as a general rule embed your video prototype here (though as this has already been evaluated separately you will not be graded down for not including it if there is some technical or practical challenge in doing so).

## Feedback 
Briefly describe how the prototype was evaluated and highlight key findings, especially any that were surprising or went against your expectations. Being able to interpret the findings and select which are most useful to share is as important as being able to collect the data in the first place.


## Redesign 
Present the next progression of your design idea. Note that we are cutting our iterative process off at this stage and keeping it brief. You should use this design phase to articulate how your evaluation findings are moving forward your design thinking. You do not need to build out an entire interface.
